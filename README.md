Login Info | username : "Mert" & password : "1234" 
The program requires administrator login for the management panel. Also it includes sign-up option.

It can create file "Memberlist.txt" according to user. When you delete a member (from member management interface) program will create updated file called "NewMemberlist.txt" You can see example files in this repo.

That program developed on DevC++ IDE.

Program contains features like bmi calculation, file recording etc.

All the codes are created by me. That's not a quote.
