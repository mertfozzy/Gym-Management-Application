Mid-Sized C Project : Gym Management Software. It can create new members, and manage them.

The program requires administrator login for the management panel. Also it includes sign-up option.

It can create file "Memberlist.txt" according to user. You can see an example file in this repo.

That program developed on DevC++ IDE.

Program contains features like bmi calculation, file recording etc.

Program can be a bit mistaken. I try to fix bugs daily.
